### ⚙️ Project Overview

Maritime transport moves over 80% of global trade and faces rising **economic and environmental pressures**.  
Fuel can account for up to **60% of voyage expenses**, while IMO 2050 targets demand at least **50% GHG reduction**.  

This project explores how **AI-driven optimization models** can enhance ship voyage planning by balancing:
- Voyage **cost efficiency**
- **Safety** and operational feasibility
- **Emission reduction** targets  

The objective is to find optimal voyage performance across **economic**, **operational**, and **environmental** criteria.

### 🧩 Research Motivation

Traditional economic optimization using linear regression fails to capture **nonlinear interactions** among:
- Operational constraints (speed, draft, schedule)  
- Weather and sea conditions  
- Port congestion and capacity  
- Bunker fuel price volatility  

AI and machine learning models enable **multi-objective optimization** under uncertainty — producing adaptive, data-driven strategies for sustainable voyage planning.

### 🧠 Methodology & Data

**Dataset:**  
Synthetic dataset of **336 voyage legs**, covering:
- Operational and environmental conditions  
- Top-10 major port capacity and performance metrics  
- Fuel consumption and voyage time indicators  

**Model Pipeline:**
1. Data preprocessing  
2. Model training and tuning  
3. Model comparison and validation  
4. Feature importance analysis  

**Models Evaluated:**
| Model | MSE (mean) | MAE (mean) | R² (mean) | Train time (s) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Linear Regression | 1.12e+13 | 1.22e+06 | 0.917 | 0.015 |
| Random Forest | 1.07e+13 | 1.13e+06 | 0.923 | 1.14 |
| XGBoost | **8.58e+12** | **9.88e+05** | **0.941** | 1.42 |
| Neural Network | 1.09e+13 | 1.28e+06 | 0.916 | 7.07 |

✅ **XGBoost** achieved the best trade-off between accuracy and training speed (R² ≈ 0.94).
