### Project Overview

Maritime transport moves over 80% of global trade and faces rising **economic and environmental pressures**.  
Fuel can account for up to **60% of voyage expenses**, while IMO 2050 targets demand at least **50% GHG reduction**.  

This project explores how **AI-driven optimization models** can enhance ship voyage planning by balancing:
- Voyage **cost efficiency**
- **Safety** and operational feasibility
- **Emission reduction** targets  

The objective is to find optimal voyage performance across **economic**, **operational**, and **environmental** criteria.

---

### Motivation

Traditional economic optimization using linear regression fails to capture **nonlinear interactions** among:
- Operational constraints (speed, draft, schedule)  
- Weather and sea conditions  
- Port congestion and capacity  
- Bunker fuel price volatility  

AI and machine learning models enable **multi-objective optimization** under uncertainty ‚Äî producing adaptive, data-driven strategies for sustainable voyage planning.

### Methodology & Data

**Dataset:**  
Synthetic dataset of **336 voyage legs**, covering:
- Operational and environmental conditions  
- Top-10 major port capacity and performance metrics  
- Fuel consumption and voyage time indicators

### Result
<img src="/research/ai-voyage-planner-3.png?raw=true" alt="AI Voyage Planning fig 3" class="poster"/>
**XGBoost** achieved the best trade-off between accuracy and training speed based on R2 value.

### Key Insights
<img src="/research/ai-voyage-planner-4.png?raw=true" alt="AI Voyage Planning fig 4" class="poster"/>
- **Distance**, **cargo weight**, and **planned speed** are the most influential determinants of cost and emissions.  
- **Tree-based models** outperform linear baselines by capturing complex relationships between voyage factors.  
- Model rankings remained stable across runs, confirming robust, generalizable performance.

### Impact & Future Directions

- **Dynamic Routing Optimization:**  
  Compute energy-efficient routes in real time, adapting to weather and port congestion.  
- **Reinforcement Learning & Digital Twins:**  
  Enable autonomous adjustment of vessel speed and scheduling during operations.  
- **Economic Relevance:**  
  Integrating intelligent routing supports **supply chain resilience**, reduces costs, and accelerates decarbonization.
